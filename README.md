# Installation Guide
Follow these steps to install this module in Vue Storefront.\
We tried to be as specific as possible, if you need help don't hesitate to contact us. Please find below the options to get support.

First, make sure you meet these requirements for your Magento 2 installation.

# Requirements for Magento 2
1. Mollie Payments for Magento 2 module installed, you can get it here: https://github.com/mollie/magento2
1. Install Get Noticed Magento 2 Order extension attributes module: 

```shell
composer require getnoticed/module-vsf-mollie
php bin/magento module:enable GetNoticed_VsfMollie
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

# Requirements for Vue Storefront API
Add the Vue Storefront API extension we created for the Mollie Payments API: https://github.com/Lakefields/vsf-payment-service-api - you can follow the installation steps in the ReadMe in this repository.

# Requirements for Vue Storefront
After making sure to meet the above mentioned requirements, please follow the next steps to integrate this module in Vue Storefront.

Clone this git repository from within your vue-storefront root folder

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Lakefields/vsf-payment-service.git src/modules/vsf-payment-service
```

# Module registration
Open `src/modules/client.ts`

Add:

```js
...
import { PaymentModule } from './vsf-payment-service'
```

And make sure to also register the module in registerClientModules

```js
...
registerModule(PaymentModule)
```

# Add configuration settings

Add the config properties in `config/local.json`

```
"paymentService": {
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/ext/vsf-payment-service-api",
  "error_url": "route_to_error_page",
  "invalid_payment_status_check_url": "route_to_invalid_payment_status_page"
},
```

Make sure to set the correct location to your API and the routes to the CMS pages in case of an error or an invalid payment status check.

# Integration to theme
We used the default theme, below we'll sum up the changes that are necessary to completely integrate this module to your own theme if you're not using Vue Storefront default theme.

* Add a method to the currentPage mixin to hide header and footer when communication with Mollie API is processing - add condition to show header and footer in components depending on this method
* Remove default ThankYouPage as the customer goes immediately to the Mollie payment gateway to pay for the placed order. The customer comes back to a customized order status page.
* Add customizations to Payment component to only show payment methods configured in Mollie account (**You can copy/paste the Payment component from this module to your default theme**)
* Add customizations to Payment component to let customers who can pay with iDeal to choose for their bank.

* Open the file `components/organisms/o-payment.vue` in the theme.
* Add the following code after the payment method selection block 

```vue
...
<div class="form__radio-group">
<SfRadio
  v-for="method in paymentMethods"
  :key="method.code"
  v-model="payment.paymentMethod"
  :label="method.title ? method.title : method.name"
  :value="method.code"
  name="payment-method"
  class="form__radio payment-method"
  @input="changePaymentMethod"
/>
</div>
<MIdealIssuers v-if="isIdeal" />
...
```
```vuejs
...
import MIdealIssuers from '@getnoticed/vsf-payment-service/components/molecules/m-ideal-issuers'
```
```vuejs
...
components: {
MIdealIssuers
},
mixins: [Payment, MIdealIssuers],

### Disabling redirection to Thank You page and adding a loader until the client is redirected to the mollie payment gateway.
* Open the file `pages/Checkout.vue` in the theme.
* Add the following code 
```vuejs
...
methods: {
    async onAfterPlaceOrder (payload) {
      debugger
      this.confirmation = payload.confirmation
      // Prevented redirect to ThankYou page
      // this.$store.dispatch('checkout/setThankYouPage', true)
      this.$store.dispatch('user/getOrdersHistory', { refresh: true, useCache: true })
      Logger.debug(payload.order)()
    },
    placeOrder () {
      this.checkConnection({ online: typeof navigator !== 'undefined' ? navigator.onLine : true })
      if (this.checkStocks()) {
        // Display loader before going to payment gateway
        this.$store.dispatch('checkout/placeOrder', { order: this.prepareOrder() }).then(() => {
          this.$bus.$emit(
            'notification-progress-start',
            this.$t('Processing order...')
          )
        })
      } else {
        this.notifyNotAvailable()
      }
    }
  }
```
